We concatenate these two states and use the result to initialize the corresponding layer of the decoder. (In the example, we concatenate $h_{0,4}$ and $h_{0,4}'$ to initialize layer 0, and we concatenate $h_{1,4}$ and $h_{1,4}'$ to initialize layer 1.)

But instead of only keeping the single argmax at each position, beam search maintains the $K$ best partial hypotheses $H_t = \\{(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}): k\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\}$ at every step $t$. To proceed to $t+1$, we compute the scores of sequences  $y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}, y_{t+1}$ for every possible extension $y_{t+1}\\in \\mathcal{V}$ and every possible prefix $(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_t^{(k)}) \\in H_t$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the vocabulary. Among these $K\\times |\\mathcal{V}|$ sequences, we only keep the top $K$ sequences with the best partial scores, and that becomes $H_{t+1} = \\{(y_1^{(k)}, \\ldots, y_{t+1}^{(k)}): k\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}\\}$. To start at $t=1$, $H_1 = \\{(y): y \\in \\text{K argmax}_{y_1\\in\\mathcal{V}} \\log P(y_1|y_0=bos) \\}$. Here $K$ is called the beam size.\n",
