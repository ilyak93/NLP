This expression thus defines a _property_, the property of originating in Boston.\n",

(This is not a coincidence, even though [Guido van Rossum is not a fan](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196).)

So far, we've seen how to use the syntactic parse tree to guide the composition of semantic representations. In project segment 4, you will automate this process by implementing such a generic semantic parser, which takes any tree with associated semantic rules, and constructs the meaning representation, doing just the work you've been doing by hand here."
