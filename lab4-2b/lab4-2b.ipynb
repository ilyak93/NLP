In FOL, there are only two quantifiers, the universal quantifier $\\forall$ (\"for all\") and the existential quantifier $\\exists$ (\"there exists\"). In natural language, we find many more quantifiers. A few examples:\n", "\n", "* Universal: \"every\", \"each\"\n", "* Existential: \"some\", \"a(n)\"\n", "* Exact counts: \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"infinitely many\"\n", "* Approximate counts: \"few\", \"many\", \"most\", \"several\"\n", "* Count bounds: \"more than three\", \"fewer than 100\""]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Natural language quantifiers can be thought of as expressing a _relationship between two properties_. \n", "\n", "> Recall that a _property_ can be thought of as a set of objects (those bearing the property) or a function from objects to truth values (which takes the objects that bear the property to _true_ and objects not bearing the property to false). In our flight world, $Flight$ is a property, as is $\\lambda x. Origin(x, Boston)$ (\"objects originating in Boston\").\n", "\n", "Natural language quantifiers like \"every\" express a relationship between two properties, the _restriction_ of the quantifier and the _scope_ of the quantifier. For instance, in the sentence \"every flight leaves from Boston\", the restriction property is expressed by  \"flight\" and the scope property is expressed by \"leaves from Boston\". The relationship that \"every\" expresses is simply that everything bearing the first property also bears the second. Similarly, \"some\" expresses the relationship that there is something bearing the first property that also bears the second property. And \"most\" expresses that most (at least half, say) of the objects bearing the first property bear the second property.\n", "\n", "This way of thinking about quantifiers as expressing relationships between two properties is referred to as [_generalized quantifiers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_quantifier), because it generalizes the FOL notion of quantifier by adding an explicit and separate restriction.\n", "\n", "> In FOL, quantifiers $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ have only a scope and not a restriction. When we write $\\forall x. \\ldots$, the $\\ldots$ is the scope of the quantifier; we can think of this as expressing that $\\forall$ holds of the single property $\\lambda x. \\ldots$.

Flight(x) \\land Origin(x, Boston)$\n", ">\n", "> Notice though that in incorporating the restriction ($Flight(x)$) into the scope of the FOL quantifier, we use different ways of combining them depending on the quantifier. That's somewhat inelegant. More importantly, for most NL quantifiers, _there is no way of encoding the relationship between restriction and scope with just a single property_, as we happen to be able to for the universal and existential quantifiers. Hence, semanticists have moved to the generalized quantifier approach to quantifier meanings, as we do here.\n", "\n", "To allow for meanings for the first order quantifiers, we'll define some Python functions that capture this generalized quantifier approach.
